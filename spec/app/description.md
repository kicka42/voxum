# Voxum

Voxum is a voice meeting summarizer.

When you drop an audio recording (like a meeting or call) into a Google Drive folder, it automatically:

1. Transcribes the audio (figuring out who said what)
2. Creates a summary report with the main points, action items, and key takeaways
3. Emails you the summary along with the full transcript

Essentially - record your meetings, get a neat summary in your inbox without lifting a finger.
